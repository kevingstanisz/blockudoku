I used to play BlockuDoku on the iPhone a lot. And by a lot, I mean was very much so addicted. This was to the point that I would be willing to turn my phone on airplane mode in order to avoid all of the ads that this app made me watch!

I got so sick and tired of the ad I decided to make the game as a web application. I added a leaderboard so my friends and I could compete against each other. 

Below or some GIF's of the gameplay. 




Drag the block onto the board. Shadow on the board shows where block will get dropped. Get points per block added. 


Complete a row, column, or square to remove those blocks and get extra points. 


Remove more than one or remove blocks in consecutive turns to get a bonus!


Blocks gray out on bottom when they cannot fit in puzzle. 


Try it out on mobile, too!


Board and scores save to local storage. 


Save name to leaderboard after losing. 


No using bad words, though! Shoutout to Neutrino API - allows me to add custom bad words so I can add "Bears" as a bad word. Go Packers!


Leaderboard shows highest score and most recent score.
