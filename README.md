I used to play BlockuDoku on the iPhone a lot. And by a lot, I mean was very much addicted to the game. This was to the point that I would be willing to turn my phone on airplane mode in order to avoid all of the ads that this app made me watch!

I got so sick and tired of the ads I decided to make the game as a web application. I added a leaderboard so my friends and I could compete against each other. 

Below or some GIF's of the gameplay. 

#### Drag the block onto the board. Shadow on the board shows where block will get dropped. Get points per block added.

#### Complete a row, column, or square to remove those blocks and get extra points.

#### Remove more than one or remove blocks in consecutive turns to get a bonus!

#### Save name to leaderboard after losing. 
###### No using bad words, though! Shoutout to Neutrino API - allows me to add custom bad words so I can add "b3ar5" as a bad word. Go Packers!
